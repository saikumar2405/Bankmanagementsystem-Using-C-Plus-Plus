# Bankmanagementsystem-Using-C-Plus-Plus
The Bank Management System is an application for maintaining a person&#39;s account in a bank.
In this project we tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic
functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving
financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of
an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks

The Bank Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies. The
main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Management System. This project
has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with
the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. This project is developed using
C++. Creating and managing requirements is a challenge of IT, systems and product
development projects or indeed for any activity where you have to manage a contractual
relationship. Organization need to effectively define and manage requirements to ensure they
are meeting needs of the customer, while proving compliance and staying on the schedule
and within budget. The impact of a poorly expressed requirement can bring a business out of
compliance or even cause injury or death. Requirements definition and management is an
activity that can deliver a high, fast return on investment.
The project analyzes the system requirements and then comes up with the requirements
specifications. It studies other related systems and then come up with system specifications.
The system is then designed in accordance with specifications to satisfy the requirements.

Thus, above features of this project will save transaction time and therefore increase the
efficiency of the system.
